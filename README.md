# Model Based Control and Reinforcement Learning Tutorials

A collection of simple and clean implementations of model-based control and reinforcement learning approaches.
The implementations do not aim to be general enough, but rather easily understood, for learning/understanding purpose.
Currently the collection includes:

- [Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI)](https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/10.2514/1.G001921) 

# Installation
```
cd your_project_folder
git clone https://github.com/amolchanov86/model_based_rl.git
cd model_based_rl/
git checkout release
```

# MPPI
- Running 2D pointmass example:
```
./mppi/mppi_pointmass.py
```

- Running 3D pointmass example:
```
./mppi/mppi_3dpointmass.py
```
